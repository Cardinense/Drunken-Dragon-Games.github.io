### **PixelTiles** are **exclusively** rewarded to [DND] Drunken Dragon Pool delegators every 1st and 15th of each month. 

### **PixelTiles** are similar to Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh cards, limited quantity with some much rarer than others, assured by the Cardano blockchain.

### New **PixelTiles** are forged every week, follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DNDCardanoPool) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rwY7Vsjcnr) to stay up-to-date and ask any question!
