[DND on Cardano Scan](https://cardanoscan.io/pool/0084f4fee5502c87ee5c4f5c592856f2bfb6269355b9d87ed549e551) 

[DND on PoolTool](https://pooltool.io/pool/0084f4fee5502c87ee5c4f5c592856f2bfb6269355b9d87ed549e551/epochs)

We maintain secure, profitable and professional pools and reward our delegators in a **fun** and **exclusive** way! DND pool delegators will be rewarded and have access to exclusive sales of fantasy-themed collectable **Pixel Tiles tokens** that you can trade and use to build beautiful pixel art dioramas!

The **Pixel Tiles tokens** will be **exclusively** rewarded to Drunken Dragon Pool delegators and **also** offered exclusive sales. 

Pixel Tile tokens will be similar to Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh cards, limited quantity with some much rarer than others. See the [FAQ](/faq.html).

The profit of the pool and exclusive token sales will be used for:

* To develop an app to build the dioramas and trade Pixel Tiles
* To generate free Cardano Plutus smart contract educational content
* And for the development of a decentralized governance solution for open source projects

Therefore delegating with a Drunken Dragon Pool and trading Pixel Tile tokens will be a direct investment to the Cardano ecosystem and community! (More information to come)
