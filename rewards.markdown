## TLDR

The minimum delegation required to enter the raffle is 100 ADA.

Every 1st and 15th of the month, delegators have the chance of being rewarded 1 PixelTile automatically based on a raffle system: The more you delegate, the greater your chance of getting a rare PixelTile. You must delegate for at least 1 complete epoch to enter the raffle.

You have nothing to do, Rewards arrive automatically!

Because of the limited supply of Pixel Tiles we reward a limited amount of Pixel Tiles per raffle (still plenty). See bellow for raffle Pixel Tiles.

## Reward System

* There are 2 reward dates every month, the 1st and the 15th.
* Rewards are given automatically.
* A set of Epic, Rare, and Uncommon Pixel Tiles are raffled on each reward date to different delegators tiers.
* Every 100 ADA delegated gives you 1 raffle ticket, every 1000 ADA gives you an extra raffle ticket bonus and every 10,000 ADA gives you another bonus raffle ticket, so for example, if you delegate 10,000 you will get 111 raffle tickets: 100 normal tickets, 10 for your 1,000's bonus, and 1 from your 10,000s bonus.
* The raffles goes in order, first, the rarest PixelTile is raffled, the more tickets you have, the more chances for you to get it.
* When someone wins a raffle he takes the PixelTile and his tickets are removed for the next PixelTiles raffles.
* The raffles continue until all rare PixelTiles are over.
* You must be a delegator for at least 1 complete epoch to enter the raffle
* We have a tier system, depending on how much ADA you are delegating it is the raffle tier you will be playing on.
* See the raffled Pixel Tiles per tier bellow.
