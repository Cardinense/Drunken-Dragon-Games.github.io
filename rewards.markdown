Our mission is to make people’s lives worth living by creating a dynamic universe to experience and share our love and passion for fantasy

We are building lore, a video game, NFT collectibles, and some un-announced experiences, all of these to build the Drunken Dragon universe for you to experience.
For this, we need your support; one way to help us create this universe is by delegating your ADA to our pool!
