Hello adventurers, **Vledic Franco** here, the second time we deliver rewards has been successful with all the 40 PixelTiles that has been worked on on the last weeks! As always I am excited to see where the community is going, what makes Cardano great is not just the top of the notch research and technology, is all the wonderful persons that I keep meeting.

Important to note is that for the next reward date (1st of June) the rewards rules will change, so keep an eye on our Twitter, Discord and/or blog for more information to come.

Thank you to our first delegators! It means a lot to me that you are supporting this project in its early days.

## Why did I received some Ada together with the PixelTiles?

There is currently a minimum Ada requirement for every transaction to prevent garbage transactions and keep the blockchain performant.

## How often are the PixelTiles rewards?

Every 1st and 15th of the month.

## Are they randomly rewarded?

Rules will change for next date, please follow our Twitter, Discord and blog.

## What are the PixelTiles rarities?

Similar to popular RPGs/MMORPGs it is based on colors, each color represent how many PixelTiles of this type will be minted once and only once, for example right now it only exists 100 **PixelTile #3 Necromancer** and never will ever exist more under the same policy.

* Common - Gray (1000 minted)
* Uncommon - Green (500 minted)
* Rare - Blue (250 minted)
* Epic - Purple (100 minted)
* Legendary - Orange (10 minted)

## How can I see the current collection?

We will always keep at least 1 of each for record reasons, and can be seen in the Drunken Dragon Pool (DND) owner wallet.

## How can I see my PixelTiles?

Use Smaug Pool's tool https://pool.pm/, you can simply copy any of your "receiving wallets" from Daedalus and append it on the url address like so: 

Imagine one of your Daedalus receiving addresses is **addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

then you append it to the https://pool.pm/ like this: **https://pool.pm/addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

## I have a question, how can I contact the Drunken Dragon Pool team?

[Join the Discord please!](https://discord.gg/rwY7Vsjcnr) I would be very happy to chat.

## Who drew the pixel art?

Me! But I am looking for a pixel artist to take some work from me, contact me if you know someone who is also passionate about making a difference in the world.
