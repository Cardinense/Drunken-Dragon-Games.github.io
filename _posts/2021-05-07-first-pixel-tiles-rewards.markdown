Hello adventurers, **Vledic Franco** here, earlier this week we minted our first 10 Pixel Tiles (working on more!), and as promised we have rewarded our first 8 delegators with 3 random PixelTiles each! Check the links below to see who received what, thanks to Smaug Pool for developing the tool. Also I would like to state how happy I am of being part of the Cardano community, I see much happening fruit of emotions of love, I have met many inspiring persons, not just Charles Hoskinson with his strong leadership but so many individuals moved by the vision of a better, more fair and exciting future. I only hope to be a possitive actor in this movement.

## Why did I received some Ada together with the PixelTiles?

There is currently a minimum Ada requirement for every transaction to prevent garbage transactions and keep the blockchain performant.

## How often are the PixelTiles rewards going to happen?

Due to the minimum Ada requirements I have decided to send 3 PixelTiles twice per month (around every 3rth Cardano epoch).

## Are they randomly rewarded?

For now yes, we might change how we reward them but for now I used this distribution: www.drunkendragon.games/data/pixeltiles-distribution.txt

## What are the PixelTiles rarities?

Similar to popular RPGs/MMORPGs it is based on colors, each color represent how many PixelTiles of this type will be minted once and only once, for example right now it only exists 100 **PixelTile #3 Necromancer** and never will ever exist more under the same policy.

* Common - Gray (1000 minted)
* Uncommon - Green (500 minted)
* Rare - Blue (250 minted)
* Epic - Purple (100 minted)

## How can I see the current collection?

We will always keep at least 1 of each for record reasons, and can be seen in the Drunken Dragon Pool (DND) owner wallet.

## How can I see my PixelTiles?

Use Smaug Pool's tool https://pool.pm/, you can simply copy any of your "receiving wallets" from Daedalus and append it on the url address like so: 

Imagine one of your Daedalus receiving addresses is **addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

then you append it to the https://pool.pm/ like this: **https://pool.pm/addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

## I have a question, how can I contact the Drunken Dragon Pool team?

[Join the Discord please!](https://discord.gg/rwY7Vsjcnr) I would be very happy to chat.

## Who drew the pixel art?

Me! But I am looking for a pixel artist to take some work from me, contact me if you know someone who is also pationate about making a difference in the world.
