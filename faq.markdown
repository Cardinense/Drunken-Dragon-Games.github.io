## What is your ticker?

DRDR

## How does it work?

The list of wallet addresses that delegate to DRDR is public and registered in the blockchain hence the rewards will arrive automatically, in the same manner, the exclusive token sales will be limited to wallets that delegate to DRDR. The exact reward rules will be published shortly before releasing the first collection, but be sure that we will reward loyal delegators and supporters!

* We will mint 1 collection of Pixel Tiles per season. 
* Each collection will be exclusive and we will never mint more of the same "theme" again.
* The first Pixel Tiles collection will be Fantasy Tavern themed!

## When will the first Pixel Tiles be minted?

The first collection will be minted and rewarded as soon as we reach 50% of saturation, so share the love and help us reach the checkpoint!

## Are these similar to NFTs?

Yes and no, Pixel Tiles are semi-fungible tokens, which means that instead of being unique, there are a limited amount of them in circulation, imagine there were only 10 Charizard Pokemon cards in the world and it was impossible to create more, these would be "fungible" between them but of limited existence.

## How can I use the tokens to build the dioramas?

With the pool profits the Drunken Dragon Pixel Tiles App will be funded, in this App you will be able to sync your public wallet address, load your Pixel Tiles and build dioramas to share with friends and the community!

Other features will also be added with time once smart contracts are available on Cardano, like decentralized trading.

## Who is maintaining the pool and developing the tokens?

![Vledic](/assets/img/vledic.jpg)

My nickname is Vledic, I am a professional functional programmer and independent backend contractor with more than 10 years of experience doing things like: 

* Creating and maintaining complex backend systems for clients like ING, FedEx/TNT and Audi. 
* Teaching and training in functional programming both for free and paid.
* Contributing to open source projects.

Besides maintaining the Drunken Dragon Pool, I am part of the Plutus Pioneer Program and an active community member of Project Catalyst, but most importantly I strongly believe in the future of Cardano, in its community and in its role as a positive paradigm change for humanity; that is why I want to eventually stop my backend contracting business to fully dedicate myself to nourishing the Cardano community and ecosystem through teaching and creating disruptive technology, I wish to be part of this exciting future with all of you.
