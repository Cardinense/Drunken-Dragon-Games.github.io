## Who is maintaining the pool and developing PixelTiles?

[@francoaramburo](https://twitter.com/francoaramburo)

My nickname is Vledic, full name Francisco and Franco for short, I am a professional functional programmer and independent backend contractor with more than 10 years of experience doing things like: 

* Creating and maintaining complex backend systems for clients like ING, FedEx/TNT and Audi. 
* Teaching and training in functional programming both for free and paid.
* Contributing to open source projects.

Besides maintaining the Drunken Dragon Pool, I am part of the Plutus Pioneer Program and an active community member of Project Catalyst, but most importantly I strongly believe in the future of Cardano, in its community and in its role as a positive paradigm change for humanity; that is why I want to eventually stop my backend contracting business to fully dedicate myself to nourishing the Cardano community and ecosystem through teaching and creating disruptive technology, I wish to be part of this exciting future with all of you.

## How do the PixelTiles rewards work?

The list of wallet addresses that delegate to DND Pool is public and registered in the blockchain hence the rewards will arrive automatically. 

## Are these similar to NFTs?

Yes and no, Pixel Tiles are semi-fungible tokens, which means that instead of being unique, there are a limited amount of them in circulation, imagine there were only 10 Charizard Pokemon cards in the world and it was impossible to create more, these would be "fungible" between them but of limited existence.

## How can I use PixelTiles to build the dioramas?

With the pool profits the Drunken Dragon Pixel Tiles App will be funded, in this App, you will be able to sync your public wallet address, load your Pixel Tiles and build dioramas to share with friends and the community!

Other features will also be added with time once smart contracts are available on Cardano, like decentralized trading.

## Why did I receive some Ada together with the PixelTiles?

There is currently a minimum Ada requirement for every transaction to prevent garbage transactions and keep the blockchain performant.

## How often are the PixelTiles rewards happening?

Due to the minimum Ada requirements, I have decided to send 3 PixelTiles twice per month (around every 3rth Cardano epoch).

## Are they randomly rewarded?

For now yes, we might change how we reward them but for now I used this distribution: www.drunkendragon.games/data/pixeltiles-distribution.txt

## What are the PixelTiles rarities?

Similar to popular RPGs/MMORPGs it is based on colours, each colour represents how many PixelTiles of this type will be minted once and only once, for example, right now it only exists 100 **PixelTile #3 Necromancer** and never will ever exist more under the same policy.

* Common - Gray (1000 minted)
* Uncommon - Green (500 minted)
* Rare - Blue (250 minted)
* Epic - Purple (100 minted)
* Legendary - Orange (10 minted)

## How can I see the current collection?

We will always keep at least 1 of each for record reasons and can be seen in the Drunken Dragon Pool (DND) owner wallet.

## How can I see my PixelTiles?

Use Smaug Pool's tool https://pool.pm/, you can simply copy any of your "receiving wallets" from Daedalus and append it on the URL address like so: 

Imagine one of your Daedalus receiving addresses is **addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

then you append it to the https://pool.pm/ like this: **https://pool.pm/addr1q92ud207pzspdpt8ywptmv8wlg26l8syh0ayk48rp90ltegufvhswpdcca36zk44q2u6qnkqf283fv8yshgkk3x4ffds2lpws9**

## I have a question, how can I contact the Drunken Dragon Pool team?

[Join the Discord please!](https://discord.gg/rwY7Vsjcnr) I would be very happy to chat.

## Who drew the pixel art?

Me! But I am looking for a pixel artist to take some work from me, contact me if you know someone who is also passionate about making a difference in the world.
